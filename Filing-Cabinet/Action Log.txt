Windows

On Windows, choosing 32 or 64-bit libraries should be based on which platform you want to compile for, not
which OS you have. Indeed, you can perfectly compile and run a 32-bit program on a 64-bit Windows. So
you'll most likely want to target 32-bit platforms, to have the largest possible audience. Choose 64-bit
packages only if you have good reasons.
